# $${\color{skyblue}Overview}$$
This file contains $${\color{red}30}$$ ggplot graphs in R.

It contains a R file named ${\color{#c5f015}R-codes\space for\space graph}$ in which you will get the codes for all the 30 graphs.
Before graph of every code we have specified the number of the graphs. I have also used those graph numbers in the PNG file.

For example ${\color{#c5f015}5.png}$ contains the image of the graph whose code is written after #5 in that R code file.
